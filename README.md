# Game of Thrones Interactive Map:

An interactive map based on the fantasy fictional novels 'A Song of Ice and Fire' by George R. R. Martin and the television adaptation 'Game of Thrones'. You can explore the map of Westeros and see different regions as well as many of the major points of interest and locations. The map allows you to learn about different major events that have occurred around Westeros and the region in which they occur.

Select one of the six regions on the map to reveal a news article about a major event that occured in that region.

This project was originally built as part of CM142 - Web Authoring during my Multimedia degree as DCU and was intended to introduce the fundamentals of JavaScript. I have since revisited and updated the code to align with updated knowledge.
