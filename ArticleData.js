The fire-breathing beast was struck in the heart by an Ice spear thrown by the Night King.</p> <p>The dragon named ‘Viserion’ was one of only three remaining dragons in the Seven Kingdoms. Viserion was struck in the throat by the Night King’s ice spear, sending him crashing down into a frozen lake. They were previously believed to be extinct until Daenerys Targaryen hatched three eggs.</p> <p>Daenerys Targaryen flew her dragons north from Dragonstone to aid the group of men who had become stranded on a small island in the frozen lake and surrounded by Wight’s. The group had set out to capture a Wight to prove to the rest of the world that these mythical monsters existed. The fire-breathing dragons we’re no match for the walking corpses, striking the down with ease.</p> <p>While speaking on how they should go about proving the existence of the Wights, Tyrion Lannister said; <em>“We don’t have to bring the whole army. Only one soldier.”</em></p> <p>The Night King and his army had been assembling near The Wall. The Wall is made of solid ice and is said to be more than 700 feet tall has prevented the army of the dead from moving south for thousands of years. It was built following ‘The Long Night’ when the White Walkers last terrorized the Seven Kingdoms. The majority of the population still consider these monsters a myth. The area beyond The Wall is known as ‘the land of always winter’ and is mostly uninhabited.</p> <p>A member of The Night’s Watch spoke of the dangers posed by the White walkers and said; <em>“The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years, and when they wake up, I hope the wall is high enough.”</em></p> <p>Following an intense battle, the group of warriors, along with Daenerys and her two remaining dragons escaped with a wight to bring back south of the wall. The Night King retrieved the Viserion’s body from the chilling waters and brought him back to life. The army of the dead now have the weapon they’ve needed to take down the wall and march on the Seven Kingdoms.</p>"

His murder is the result of a decision to allow the Wildlings to move south of the Wall to save them from the White Walkers.</p> <p>Ser Davos Seaworth pleaded in desperation to Red priestess Melisandre about her ability to revive him. Despite her lack of faith in the Lord of the Light, Melisandre cleansed Snow’s body and spoke the incantation to resurrect him. He awoke shortly after everyone had left the room.</p> <p>Alliser Thorne, Bowen Marsh, Othell Yarwyck, and Olly murdered Jon due to a disagreement with his decision to allow the wildings to pass through the Wall. Snow believed that since the Wildlings and the Night’s Watch were both descendants of Northerners, both had a right to be south of the Wall.</p> <p>This was the first time in several thousand years anyone other than the men of the Night’s Watch had passed the 700-foot-tall and 300 mile long solid ice wall.</p> <p>Snow was led to believe information was discovered about his missing uncle, First Ranger Benjen Stark, only to be led to a sign with the word “Traitor” written on it. The members of the Night’s Watch then stabbed snow, each proclaiming “For the Watch.” This event became known as the Mutiny at Castle Black. </p> <p>Speaking on joining the mutineers, Olly said <em>“Sometimes a man had to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others, but you know are right in the long run.”</em></p> <p>It is unclear what Jon Snow’s reaction to recent events will be, but it will undoubtedly be deadly.</p>"

His wife Talisa and mother Catelyn were also murdered in the slaughter.</p> <p>The massacre was orchestrated by Tywin Lannister, who conspired with Lord Walder Frey and Lord Roose Bolton to betray the Northern army. It was believed that Lord Frey arranged the attack to avenge the breaking of the marriage pact between House Stark and House Frey by King Robb Stark.</p> <p>Frey ate from the same bowl as the Starks to bait them into a sense of security. The attack was then signalled to begin by Frey as he said; <em>“Your Grace, I feel I’ve been remiss in my duties. I’ve given you meat and wine and music, but I haven’t shown you the hospitality you deserve. My King has married and I owe my new Queen a wedding gift”.</em></p> <p>Lady Catelyn noticed chain mail poking out of Bolton’s sleeve, and realised they have been led into a trap. She desperately tried to warn Robb, however it was too late, the attack begun.</p> <p>Lothar Frey quickly stabbed Talisa in the abdomen, killing her and her unborn child, while assassins, disguised as the musicians, opened fire on Robb, wounding him and other Northerners with crossbows. Outside the hall, more Northern Army members were killed by Frey and Bolton men.</p> <p>Arya Stark, who had been trying to sneak in to reunite with her mother, witnessed the killing of Robb’s direwolf, and was then struck unconscious and taken away by an unknown knight, presumably one of Lord Frey’s men.</p> <p>Robb crawled to Talisa to embrace her. Catelyn, who had been hiding beneath a table, dragged Frey’s wife out from under another table and put a knife to her throat, begging him to put an end to the massacre or his wife would die. She shouted at a wounded Robb to run, but he did not react. Frey calmly said he would “find another” wife, so Catelyn proceeded to slit her throat, before Roose stabbed Robb in the heart. “Black” Walder Rivers then slit Catelyn’s throat in return.</p> <p>Speaking on the horrific event, Tyrion Lannister said; <em>“The Northerners will never forget this.”</em></p> <p>Seven noble northerners along with hundreds of soldiers were slaughtered in this horrific massacre.</p>"

It is located on the west coast of Westeros and is the most notable location in the Westerlands. Tyrion Lannister, who is on the opposing side of his family appeared optimistic on the potential outcome of the siege, saying; <em>“Casterly Rock is an impregnable fortress. But as a good friend of mine once said, ‘Give me ten good men and I’ll impregnate the bitch!’.”</em></p> <p>Grey Worm, leader of the Unsullied army led a small group through hidden caves and sewers beneath Casterly Rock with information provided by Tyrion Lannister. This small group infiltrated the Lannister men from behind, opening the fortress gates and catching them off guard. They stormed the castle and quickly overpowered the Lannister defences. Tyrion’s knowledge of Casterly Rock was vital is the success of the siege.</p> <p>The majority of the Lannister soldiers were noticeably absent from the rock.
